Each of you has some information about which reviewers would be good for which papers, but you'll have to communicate in order to make the best assignments. \n For each game, you will see a table of reviewer-paper similarity scores. The higher the score, the better the fit. You will also see a list of reviewers and papers. You can send messages to your partner, propose assignments, and accept or reject your partner's proposals. \n Your goal is to propose a one-to-one matching between reviewers and papers with the highest sum of scores. \n You will achieve this when either one of you makes a proposal and the other person accepts it. \n All conversations must end with an accepted proposal."
